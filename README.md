# EV_Project
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of respondents' views on electric vehicles (EVs) using raw Excel data and created compelling visualizations to effectively communicate the key findings found and **explore the interest in portable chargers**. The main objectives of the project were to clean the data, extract meaningful insights, and create compelling visualizations to effectively communicate the key findings.

The data cleaning process was a crucial step to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. I carefully reviewed and rectified any inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers present in the dataset. By addressing these data quality issues, I was able to enhance the integrity of the subsequent analysis.

After cleaning the data, I utilized Power BI, to create visually appealing and interactive dashboards. The visualizations provided a comprehensive overview of the respondents' sentiments, preferences, and attitudes toward EV vehicles. These visualizations included insightful charts, graphs, and other data representations that helped in identifying trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset.

The key findings from the project shed light on critical aspects of the EV market, common concerns or misconceptions about electric vehicles, and factors influencing the adoption or rejection of this eco-friendly transportation option. These insights were valuable in understanding the public perception on the industry.
